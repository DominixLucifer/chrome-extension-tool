## How to install Chrome extensions manually
 - Download the ZIP file or clone your computer for this Chrome extension
 - Go to ```chrome://extensions/``` and check the box for Developer mode in the top right.
 - Use a ZIP Extractor app -- I used WINRAR -- to unpack the ZIP file and turn it into a folder.
 - Go back to the ```chrome://extensions/``` page and click the Load unpacked extension button and select the unzipped folder for your extension to install it.
